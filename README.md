# player_classification
The project collects data through a self-designed game and uses an LSTM model to distinguish between different players with high accuracy by analyzing their behavior patterns. This repository stores some of the core code.

Where [report.pdf](report.pdf) gives short description of the whole project, the folder [game](game) stores some core scripts, the folder [data_analyzer](data_analyzer) stores the codes implementing LSTM, and you can open [pac-man.exe](pac-man.exe) to enjoy the simple but interesting game.
